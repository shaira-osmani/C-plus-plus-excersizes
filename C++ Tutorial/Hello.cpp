#include <iostream> //This statements tells the compiler to include iostream file. This file contains pre defined input/output functions that we can use in our program.

using namespace std; // A namespace is like a region, where we have functions, variables etc and their scope is limited to that particular region. Here std is a namespace name, this tells the compiler to look into that particular region for all the variables, functions, etc.
int main(){ //main is the fucntion the int means that this func returns an int number thats why we have return 0
    cout<<"hello world";
    return 0;
}
